Description:
Raspberry pi would be controlled by REST API endpoints running on node.js with express server.
By going to a certain route, a function written in Node.JS that uses rpio library to interract with raspberry pins would power on or off the LED's connected to it (if there were any), or any other device for that matter.
This is highly extendable and could be made to interract with other online systems, receive notifications from them and then blink the LED's depending on the responses
